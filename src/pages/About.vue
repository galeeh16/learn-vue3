				Vue CLI aims to be the standard tooling baseline for the Vue
				ecosystem. It ensures the various build tools work smoothly
				together with sensible defaults so you can focus on writing your
				app instead of spending days wrangling with configurations. At
				the same time, it still offers the flexibility to tweak the
				config of each tool without the need for ejecting.

			<p class="lh-lg">
				Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework
				for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic
				frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be
				incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view
				layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other
				libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also
				perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page
				Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and
				supporting libraries.

				Form validation is a difficult subject in frontend, not only do
				you have to deal with ensuring correct values are submitted, but
				you also should provide a pleasant UX for your users. Doing form
				validation by hand is a lot of work and you won't probably cover
				all your needs if you decide to build your own. The time you
				spend working on a custom form validation solution is better
				spent building your application logic.
